**🔰 Introduction**

The Course Registration System is a web-based application developed using Java Spring Boot that streamlines the process of managing courses, users (students and admins), and course enrollments within an academic or training institution. It provides a secure and user-friendly interface for both administrators and students, ensuring seamless course registration and management workflows.

**🏗️ Architecture**

The system is based on the classic MVC layered architecture, comprising:

Model Layer: Contains JPA entity classes such as Course, UserInfo, AdminInfo, and CourseRegistration.

Repository Layer: Interfaces extending JpaRepository to perform CRUD operations.

Service Layer: Business logic for user registration, course handling, and enrollments.

Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses.

DTO Layer: Used to transfer data between the frontend and backend securely.

Frontend (View): Static and template folders under resources contain HTML files for user interaction.

**🗃️ Database Design**

UserInfo: Stores user data including name, email, password, and role.

AdminInfo: Contains admin-specific information (can be merged with UserInfo using roles).

Course: Course ID, title, description, and duration.

CourseRegistration: Maps students to the courses they have registered for.

**⚙️ Configurations**

Application runs on port: 8081

Database connection configured via application.properties

Uses JPA and Hibernate to auto-generate and manage tables in MySQL

**📈 Benefits**
